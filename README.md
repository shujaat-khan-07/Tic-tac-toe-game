# Tic-tac-toe-game
I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to alternate turns, marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. It tracks the game state, declares a winner based on predefined win patterns, and handles draw scenarios. Players can reset or start a new game.  Technologies used HTML,CSS,JS , DOM Manipulation  .
